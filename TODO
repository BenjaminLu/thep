Encrypted Strings
    Leaks length of string potentially (can this be dealt with in way that functions still work?)
    257 is prime

Implement STRCMP for encrypted strings (ascii only)
    Can be done with with GTSCOT (will get hairy since GTSCOT operates on encrypted bits)
    Another possibility is to weight characters first characters are heavily weighted, later characters, not so much
        This still conforms to the standard < 0, 0, > 0

Research new protocols (e.g. threshold homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation) and implement them.

Implement thep into other languages (python and a functional language)

Implement Elliptic curve paillier
